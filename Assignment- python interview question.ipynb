    "1. What are the built-in data types in Python?\n",
    "   Answer: The built-in data types in Python include integer, float, string, boolean, list, tuple, dictionary, and set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?\n",
    "   Answer: A list is mutable, meaning its elements can be modified, added, or removed. A tuple is immutable, and its\n",
    "        elements cannot be changed after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do you convert a string to an integer in Python?\n",
    "   Answer: You can use the `int()` function to convert a string to an integer. For example, `int(\"10\")` will return the\n",
    "    integer 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between `append()` and `extend()` methods for lists in Python?\n",
    "   Answer: The `append()` method adds a single element to the end of a list, while the `extend()` method adds multiple elements            \n",
    "        by appending each one individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the difference between `==` and `is` operators in Python?\n",
    "   Answer: The `==` operator checks for equality of values, while the `is` operator checks for identity, meaning it compares if            \n",
    "        two objects refer to the same memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you create an empty dictionary in Python?\n",
    "   Answer: You can create an empty dictionary using curly braces `{}` or by using the `dict()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in Python?\n",
    "   Answer: A shallow copy creates a new object but references the same elements as the original object, while a deep copy                  \n",
    "        creates a completely independent copy with its own set of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How do you check if a key exists in a dictionary?\n",
    "   Answer: You can use the `in` keyword to check if a key exists in a dictionary. For example, `'key' in my_dict` will return             \n",
    "    True if 'key' exists as a key in `my_dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you convert a list to a string in Python?\n",
    "   Answer: You can use the `join()` method to concatenate the elements of a list into a single string. For example, `'                   '\n",
    "        .join(my_list)` will join the elements of `my_list` with a space in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the difference between `del` and `remove()` for removing elements from a list?\n",
    "    Answer: The `del` statement removes an element at a specific index or deletes the entire list, while the `remove()` method           \n",
    "        removes the first occurrence of a specific value.\n",

    "1. Question: What is the difference between the '==' operator and the 'is' operator in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: The '==' operator checks for equality, i.e., it compares the values of two objects. The 'is' operator, on the other          \n",

    "\n",
    "2. Question: What is the ternary operator in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: The ternary operator in Python is a concise way to write a conditional expression. Its syntax is: `value_if_true if            condition else value_if_false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Question: Explain the difference between the 'and' and 'or' operators in Python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: The 'and' operator returns the first False value it encounters or the last value if all values are True. The 'or'              operator returns the first True value it encounters or the last value if all values are False.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Question: What does the '%' operator do in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: The '%' operator is the modulus operator in Python. It returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the            right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Question: What is the purpose of the 'not' operator in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: The 'not' operator is a logical operator in Python that negates the truth value of a condition. It returns True if              the condition is False, and False if the condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Question: How do you concatenate strings in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: Strings can be concatenated in Python using the '+' operator or by using the 'join()' method.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Question: Explain the 'in' operator in Python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: The 'in' operator is used to check if a value exists in a sequence (such as a string, list, or tuple). It returns              True if the value is found, and False otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Question: What is the purpose of the 'is not' operator in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: The 'is not' operator is the negation of the 'is' operator. It returns True if two objects are not the same, i.e.,              they do not refer to the same memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Question: What is operator precedence in Python?\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Answer: Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Python follows the                  PEMDAS/BODMAS rule (Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction) to                   determine the order of evaluation.\n",

    "        and “for” loops.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.When Should You Use The “Break” In Python?\n",
    "    ANS:Python provides a break statement to exit from a loop. Whenever the break hits in the code, the control of the program \n",
    "        immediately exits from the body of the loop. The break statement in a nested loop causes the control to exit from the \n",

    "4.What Is The Difference Between Pass And Continue In Python? \n",

    "1. What is a function in programming, and why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It helps in modularizing code, \n",
    "           improving code reusability, and enhancing code readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How do you define a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for parameters\n",
    "        (if any), and a colon. The function code block is indented below the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the difference between a function definition and function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: A function definition specifies the name, parameters, and code block of a function. On the other hand, a function\n",
    "        call invokes the function and passes the necessary arguments to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a return statement in a function, and why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: A return statement is used to specify the value or values to be returned from a function. It is important as it \n",
    "    allows a function to produce a result that can be used by the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the concept of function parameters and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: Parameters are the placeholders defined in the function definition to receive input values. Arguments, on the other \n",
    "        hand, are the actual values passed to the function during a function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the advantages of using default parameters in functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: Default parameters allow the function to be called with fewer arguments. They provide flexibility by assigning \n",
    "        default values to parameters if no argument is provided during the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is recursion, and how is it used in functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It is used to break down complex problems\n",
    "        into simpler subproblems, making code concise and elegant.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Describe the difference between global and local variables in relation to functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: Global variables are defined outside of any function and can be accessed throughout the program. Local variables are \n",
    "        defined within a function and are only accessible within that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the purpose of the `lambda` keyword in Python, and when is it typically used?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer: The `lambda` keyword is used to define anonymous functions (functions without a name) in a single line. It is\n",
    "        typically used when a small, one-time function is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Explain the concept of function overloading and whether Python supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer: Function overloading refers to the ability to define multiple functions with the same name but different\n",
